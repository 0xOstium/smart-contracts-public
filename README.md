This repository is adapted from the Gains v5 open-source codebase. We credit the Gains Network contributors for their work, which served as a starting point for this implementation. Significant modifications and new functionality have been introduced to align with Ostiumâ€™s protocol architecture and design objectives. This includes integrations and components specific to our system.
